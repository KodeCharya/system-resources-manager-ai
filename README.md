Perfect — the screenshot makes it much clearer! 🚀
Your project is an **AI-Powered OS Optimizer** with a GUI that monitors CPU, RAM, Disk usage, lists running processes, and even gives **AI-driven suggestions** (like disabling startup programs).

Here’s a professional `README.md` draft for your repo:
